# EMG-Controlled Prosthetic Hand with Haptic Feedback

3D-printed prosthetic hand controlled by muscle signals, with force feedback so the user can feel what they're gripping. Built for people with below-elbow limb differences.

**Status: just getting started. Parts ordered, build in progress.**

## The Idea

Cheap open-source prosthetic hands already exist. The problem is they give you zero sensory feedback, meaning you have to watch your hand constantly because you can't feel whether you're gripping too hard or too soft. Commercial hands that solve this cost $10,000 to $70,000.

This project adds haptic feedback to a low-cost design using force-sensitive resistors in the fingertips and a small vibration motor on the forearm sleeve. When the hand grips something, the user feels a buzz proportional to grip force. The whole addition costs under $10 in extra parts.

The research question: does haptic feedback actually improve grip performance compared to without it? I'll be running formal tests and posting the data here.

## Hardware (planned)

- MyoWare 2.0 EMG sensors x2
- Arduino Uno
- MG996R servo motors x4
- Force sensitive resistors x2
- Coin vibration motor
- 3D printed hand based on the e-NABLE Phoenix design, modified in Fusion 360

Total cost target: under $175.

## Status

Starting February 2026. Will update this as the build progresses.

## Background

I'm a high school junior interested in mechanical engineering. I started this project because the haptic feedback gap in low-cost prosthetics seemed like a real problem worth trying to solve, and something actually achievable without a lab. Documenting everything here as it happens.
